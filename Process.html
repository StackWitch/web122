            <h2>Design Brief – El-Shaddai International Ethiopian Church Website Redesign</h2>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                El-Shaddai International Ethiopian Church is a welcoming, multicultural Christian nonprofit based in
                Shawnee, Kansas.
                The organization supports its community through worship services, outreach events, youth programs, and
                cultural engagement.
                The goal of this redesign is to modernize the digital presence to better serve members and reach
                newcomers.

            <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
            <h3>Navigation & Structure – 1/4</h3>
            <p>
                The structure is not very intuitive. The menu needs reconstruction and stronger visual cues to indicate
                what is clickable or
                interactive. Too many pages feel buried or isolated.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessibility & Compliance – 2/4</h3>
            <p>
                Some ALT text exists, but lacks consistency. No visible ARIA landmarks or clear semantic structure.
                There's no sign of keyboard
                navigation testing or focus indicators.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual Design & Clarity – 2/4</h3>
            <p>
                The color scheme is mostly consistent with blue/white, but random color choices interrupt the flow.
                Typography doesn’t guide
                hierarchy well. It feels a bit like an afterthought.
            </p>

            <h3>Content & Language – 3/4</h3>
            <p>
                The tone is warm and informative. However, some pages repeat similar language and could be more concise
                or skimmable.
            </p>

            <h3>Functionality & Performance – 3/4</h3>
            <p>
                Pages load fine and are somewhat responsive. However, on smaller screens, some content shifts strangely
                or breaks spacing.
            </p>

            <h3>User Feedback & Error Handling – 2/4</h3>
            <p>
                Very little interactive feedback (e.g., no hover/focus states or alert messages). The contact page is
                present, but could utilize a
                form for better engagement.
            </p>

                    <h2>Website Evaluation Narrative</h2>
                    <p>
                        The current ELIEC website serves as an informative platform, providing visitors with essential
                        information about the organization's
                        mission, events, and ways to get involved. The site uses consistent branding with its blue and
                        white
                        color scheme, which helps reinforce
                        the organization's identity. Some pages load efficiently and the overall content tone is warm
                        and
                        welcoming, creating a positive impression
                        for new and returning visitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the website's navigation structure is not intuitive, making it difficult for users to
                        quickly
                        find key information. The menu
                        lacks clear visual cues to indicate clickable items, and several pages feel buried or isolated,
                        which
                        could discourage engagement.
                        Additionally, while some images have alt text, accessibility features such as ARIA landmarks and
                        keyboard navigation support are missing,
                        limiting the site's usability for visitors with disabilities. The typography and color choices
                        sometimes
                        fail to clearly establish visual
                        hierarchy, reducing content clarity and overall user experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Responsiveness is partially implemented, but the site does not consistently adapt well to
                        smaller
                        screen
                        sizes, causing some content to
                        shift awkwardly or lose spacing on mobile devices. Interactive feedback such as hover and focus
                        states
                        are minimal, and there is limited
                        user feedback on forms or clickable elements. Addressing these issues through a mobile-first
                        redesign
                        with enhanced accessibility and
                        improved navigation will greatly improve usability and engagement for all visitors.
